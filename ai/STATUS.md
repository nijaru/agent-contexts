# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-01-21_

## Current State
- Repository refactored to focus on organization patterns only
- Removed all language and tool-specific patterns
- Total files reduced from 17 to 4 core files
- Token count reduced from ~17,500 to ~2,500 (85% reduction)

## What Worked
- Consolidating scattered patterns into single PRACTICES.md
- Clear separation: organization (here) vs coding (research when needed)
- ai/ directory structure is simple and intuitive

## Active Work
Just completed major refactor to minimal meta-patterns

## Next Steps
- Gather real-world usage feedback
- Refine PRACTICES.md based on actual agent workflows
