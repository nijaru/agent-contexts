# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-10-22_

## Current State
- Version: 0.1.1
- Repository focused on AI workspace organization patterns
- Core guidance in PRACTICES.md (~1,300 words)
- ai/ directory structure established and documented
- Global config proposal submitted (openai/agents.md#91)

## What Worked
- Consolidating to single PRACTICES.md
- ai/ directory structure is simple and proven
- Clear separation: docs/ (permanent) vs ai/ (evolving)
- Global config proposal has reference implementation (github.com/nijaru/global-agents-config)

## What Didn't Work
- PRACTICES.md grew beyond initial ~600 word target (now ~1,300)
- Docs organization section may be too detailed for our focus

## Completed This Session
- Trimmed PRACTICES.md from 1,319 â†’ 807 words (39% reduction)
- Removed verbose pseudocode, kept core guidance
- Refocused on ai/ directory organization
- Updated ai/TODO.md and ai/STATUS.md
- Ready for v0.1.2 release
