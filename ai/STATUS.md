# Status

_Last Updated: 2025-01-21_

## Current State
- Repository refactored to focus on organization patterns only
- Removed all language and tool-specific patterns
- Total files reduced from 17 to 4 core files
- Token count reduced from ~17,500 to ~2,500 (85% reduction)
- Version: 0.1.0
- Added comprehensive directory organization guidance

## What Worked
- Consolidating scattered patterns into single PRACTICES.md
- Clear separation: organization (here) vs coding (research when needed)
- ai/ directory structure is simple and intuitive
- Researched industry standards (docs/adr/, ADRs, XDG, monorepo patterns)
- Clear docs/ vs ai/ separation with "knowledge graduation" flow

## What Didn't Work
- Initially unclear whether to recommend internal/ directory (too niche)
- First version of PRACTICES.md lacked clear "what goes where" guidance

## Active Work
- Updated PRACTICES.md with directory organization section
- Documented docs/ vs ai/ separation patterns
- Added ADR guidance (optional for formal projects)

## Next Steps
- Consider opening issue on openai/agents.md for global config standard
- Gather real-world usage feedback
- Refine based on actual agent workflows
